# Task Breakdown Creation

## Original Prompt
```
/sp.tasks

```

## Response Summary
Created comprehensive task breakdown for the Modern & Best-in-Class Frontend UI with:

1. **Setup Phase**: Project initialization and basic structure
2. **Foundational Phase**: Core infrastructure (API client, theme context, auth integration)
3. **User Story 1**: Premium Todo Experience (visual design, UI components, aesthetics)
4. **User Story 2**: Responsive Cross-Device Access (mobile-first responsive design)
5. **User Story 3**: Dark Mode Accessibility (theme toggle, system preferences)
6. **User Story 4**: Smooth Task Management Experience (loading states, skeleton UI, optimistic updates)
7. **User Story 5**: Accessible Design (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, WCAG compliance)
8. **User Story 6**: Secure Authentication Flow (login/signup forms, auth integration)
9. **Task Management Core**: Core task functionality components
10. **Polish Phase**: Cross-cutting improvements and final optimizations

Each task follows the required format with IDs, parallelization markers where appropriate, and specific file paths. The tasks are organized by user story priority to enable independent implementation and testing.

## Outcome
Successfully created a detailed task breakdown with 68 specific tasks that follow the checklist format and enable incremental delivery of the frontend UI features.

## Evaluation
The task breakdown is comprehensive, follows the required format, and organizes work by user story priority to enable independent implementation. All tasks include specific file paths and follow the required checklist format with proper IDs and parallelization markers.
